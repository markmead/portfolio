title: The best setup for the `.container` class in Tailwind [2021]

---
All CSS frameworks have the `.container` class, it's the most efficient way of setting a default `max-width` for your content.

In Bootstrap it's as simple as writing `.container` but in Tailwind, you'd have to write something like `container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`

This is not efficient and will cause more clutter in your HTML.

There's an easy solution for this and it's all done through the `talwind.config.js` file

Here is a link to a Tailwind play environment where it shows off the best way to setup the `.container` class in Tailwind.

So there you have it, that's the best setup for the `.container` class in Tailwind.
