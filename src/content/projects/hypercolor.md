## What is Hypercolor?

Hypercolor is a showcase of beautiful premade gradients using default colors from the Tailwind CSS palette.

- Gradients are categories into "themes" which allows them to be filtered.
- The user can adjust the direction of the gradient through buttons that change the generated Tailwind classes.
- There's a button that toggles the theme between dark and light, this is preset based on the users preferred OS theme.
- You can quickly copy the CSS through a copy to clipboard button.

Hypercolor was created by [Jordi Hales](https://twitter.com/consolelogjordi) a Laravel developer and [Mark Mead (me)](https://twitter.com/itsmarkmead).

The idea would not have been possible without [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
