## What is The Run Box?

The Run Box is a subscription box for runners, where every three months you recieve a collection of products built around your passion for running.

These products range from apparel, nutrition, accessories and wellbeing.

## How Does it Work?

The core of The Run Box is Ruby on Rails, Stripe, SpinaCMS and Devise. The website content and blog is powered via SpinaCMS, which has been customised so the client can manage users, orders and products.

We used Devise for the signup process and user account management, allowing the user to make changes to their profile, sizing and address at any time.

Stripe handles the payment, and Ruby on Rails connects them all together.

The frontend is built with TailwindCSS and AlpineJS, a combination that is perfect for production ready code, and developer experience.
