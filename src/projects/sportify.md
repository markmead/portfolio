## What is Sportify?

Sportify is an eCommerce store that allows customers to create personalised sports cards with a live preview editor.

## How Does it Work?

The website is built on Shopify, and uses their `properties` form elements to pass the custom attributes through. The live preview is handled with Alpine, and is styled with Tailwind.

As it's Shopify, there's a lot of control that's accessible for the client. Therefore, we had to make the code easy to read and easy to maintain.
